Title - Implementation and Evaluation of a CNN-RNN Hybrid Neural Network Model for Product Classification

Abstract:

Progress in deep machine learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) has led to state-of-the-art methods for image and text classification. These algorithms are widely used in many areas, such as decision making, pattern recognition, and sentiment analysis. CNN is commonly used to extract a higher-level representation of image content, while RNN is recognized as a suitable method for textual data classification. However, the usual independent use of CNN and RNN ignores the potential in exploiting the relationship between images and their associated textual description. This research aims to implement and evaluate a hybrid approach that incorporates CNN for image classification, and RNN for text classification, to improve product classification accuracy. Experiments were carried out with more than 10,000 real-world fashion product images and their associated textual descriptions. Experimental findings showed that the suggested hybrid model can achieve an accuracy of up to 97.48% and compares well with the CNN standalone accuracy of 99.54% and RNN standalone accuracy of 62.46%. Furthermore, the performance of the CNN-RNN hybrid model has been evaluated through a set of comprehensive experiments.
